though/IN not/RB without/IN redeeming/VBG qualities/NNS ,/, this/DT film/NN is/VBZ bad/JJ ./.

the/DT film/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ sprinkled/VBN with/IN these/DT real/JJ interviews/NNS throughout/IN ,/, both/DT as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT plot/NN and/CC as/IN commentary/NN on/IN the/DT situations/NNS of/IN the/DT main/JJ characters/NNS ./.
the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP real/JJ provides/VBZ a/DT refreshing/JJ break/NN from/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT more/RBR melodramatic/JJ moments/NNS in/IN the/DT film/NN ./.
there/EX are/VBP several/JJ moments/NNS of/IN bad/JJ acting/NN ,/, corny/JJ dialogue/NN ,/, and/CC emotional/JJ overextension/NN ./.
in/IN a/DT low-budget/JJ independent/JJ film/NN from/IN a/DT first-time/JJ director/NN ,/, these/DT faults/NNS can/MD sometimes/RB be/VB forgiven/VBN ,/, if/IN the/DT screenplay/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ and/CC solid/JJ ./.

we/PRP men/VBP often/RB wonder/VBP what/WP women/NNS talk/VBP about/IN when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP alone/RB in/IN groups/NNS ,/, and/CC i/JJ imagine/NN this/DT film/NN gives/VBZ me/PRP a/DT pretty/RB good/JJ idea/NN ./.

neither/CC the/DT picture/NN of/IN women/NNS ,/, nor/CC their/PRP$ picture/NN of/IN men/NNS ,/, is/VBZ truly/RB representative/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT point/NN is/VBZ that/IN both/DT sets/NNS of/IN generalizations/NNS are/VBP telling/VBG in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ way/NN ./.
