the/DT film/NN shows/VBZ what/WP happens/VBZ in/IN both/DT paths/NNS ,/, switching/VBG back/RB and/CC forth/RB between/IN intertwined/JJ ,/, parallel/JJ stories/NNS ./.
in/IN story/NN one/CD ,/, helen/VBN meets/VBZ a/DT charming/JJ and/CC talkative/JJ monty/NN python/NN fan/NN named/VBN james/NNS (/( john/NN hannah/NN )/) on/IN the/DT train/NN ./.

in/IN this/DT new/JJ life/NN ,/, helen/VBN takes/VBZ up/RP odd/JJ menial/JJ jobs/NNS ,/, and/CC faces/VBZ the/DT constant/JJ sneaking/NN suspicion/NN that/IN all/DT is/VBZ not/RB right/RB with/IN her/PRP$ relationship/NN with/IN gerry/NN ./.

at/IN last/RB here/RB 's/POS proof/NN that/IN there/EX 's/VBZ still/RB creativity/NN in/IN 1990s/CD filmmaking/NN ./.
sliding/VBG doors/NNS is/VBZ refreshingly/RB different/JJ from/IN anything/NN this/DT year/NN ./.
not/RB only/RB is/VBZ it/PRP a/DT well-acted/JJ ,/, heartwarming/JJ film/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ also/RB easily/RB gwyneth/JJ paltrow/NN 's/POS best/JJS recent/JJ performance/NN ./.
when/WRB helen/VBN (/( paltrow/NN )/) screams/NNS that/IN her/PRP$ unfaithful/JJ boyfriend/NN is/VBZ a/DT 'shagging/VBG wanker/NN ,/, '/'' (/( a/DT british/JJ phrase/NN better/RB left/VBD untranslated/JJ )/) she/PRP sounds/VBZ like/IN she/PRP knows/VBZ what/WP she/PRP 's/VBZ talking/VBG about/IN !/.
nor/CC does/VBZ sliding/VBG doors/NNS go/VB overboard/RB with/IN formulaic/JJ true/JJ love/NN or/CC other/JJ stereotypes/NNS ./.
nobody/NN scrambles/NNS around/RB in/IN danger/NN ,/, screaming/VBG ,/, ``/`` i/NNS will/MD find/VB you/PRP no/DT matter/NN what/WP ,/, my/PRP$ darling/NN !/. ``/``
when/WRB helen/VBN finds/VBZ herself/PRP on/IN a/DT boat/NN in/IN the/DT starlight/NN with/IN james/NNS ,/, she/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB take/VB the/DT easy/JJ way/NN out/IN and/CC leap/VB into/IN his/PRP$ arms/NNS ,/, since/IN she/PRP 's/VBZ supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB recovering/VBG from/IN heartache/NN ./.

another/DT example/NN :/: when/WRB one/CD of/IN the/DT protagonists/NNS lies/VBZ wounded/VBN in/IN a/DT hospital/NN ,/, sliding/VBG doors/NNS gives/VBZ us/PRP neither/CC the/DT 'hospital/JJ miracle/NN '/'' nor/CC a/DT maudlin/NN tragedy/NN but/CC surprises/VBZ us/PRP with/IN a/DT third/JJ variation/NN ./.
in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN the/DT characters/NNS seem/VBP non-stereotyped/JJ ,/, human/JJ ,/, and/CC local/JJ ./.
there/EX are/VBP minor/JJ inconveniences/NNS ./.
since/IN sliding/VBG doors/NNS switches/VBZ back/RB and/CC forth/RB between/IN two/CD possible/JJ fates/NNS ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ occasionally/RB difficult/JJ to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN the/DT two/CD ./.

also/RB ,/, quite/RB a/DT few/JJ snappy/JJ comebacks/NNS referring/VBG to/TO american/JJ pop/NN culture/NN (/( seinfeld/JJ ,/, woody/JJ allen/NN ,/, etc/FW ./. )/) are/VBP spoken/VBN by/IN the/DT british/JJ characters/NNS ./.
but/CC these/DT seem/NN slightly/RB forced/VBN ,/, given/VBN that/IN the/DT remaining/VBG dialogue/NN is/VBZ predominantly/RB british/JJ slang/NN ./.
possibly/RB an/DT attempt/NN by/IN the/DT screenwriter/NN to/TO balance/VB the/DT british/JJ so/IN that/IN american/JJ audiences/NNS can/MD feel/VB more/RBR comfortable/JJ ?/.
sliding/VBG doors/NNS is/VBZ a/DT charming/JJ ,/, quirky/JJ ,/, original/JJ ,/, happy/JJ romance/NN with/IN a/DT little/JJ 'philosophy/NN of/IN fate/NN '/POS thrown/NN in/IN ./.
monty/NN python/NN and/CC the/DT meaning/NN of/IN fate/NN ,/, anybody/NN ?/.
