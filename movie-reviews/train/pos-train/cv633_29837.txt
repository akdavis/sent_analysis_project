braveheart/NN was/VBD only/RB the/DT second/JJ film/NN in/IN the/DT directorial/JJ career/NN by/IN mel/NN gibson/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP would/MD n't/RB be/VB fair/JJ to/TO compare/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT better/JJR known/VBN genre/NN classics/NNS directed/VBN by/IN david/JJ lean/NN or/CC anthony/DT mann/NN ./.
however/RB ,/, even/RB when/WRB we/PRP apply/VBP such/JJ criteria/NNS braveheart/NN is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN decent/JJ historical/JJ epic/NN that/WDT takes/VBZ new/JJ and/CC refreshing/JJ approach/NN to/TO the/DT genre/NN ./.
the/DT most/RBS noticeable/JJ element/NN of/IN this/DT approach/NN is/VBZ naturalism/NN ./.
while/IN older/JJR hollywood/NN films/NNS set/VBN in/IN medieval/JJ europe/NN used/VBN to/TO give/VB fairytale-like/JJ vision/NN of/IN picturesque/NN castles/NNS ,/, splendid/VBD costumes/NNS and/CC knights/NNS in/IN shining/VBG armour/NN ,/, gibson/NN shows/VBZ us/PRP the/DT extremely/RB unpleasant/JJ world/NN of/IN poverty/NN and/CC feudal/JJ injustice/NN where/WRB might/MD made/VB right/JJ and/CC life/NN was/VBD hard/JJ ,/, short/JJ and/CC brutish/JJ ./.
this/DT general/JJ unpleasantness/NN is/VBZ especially/RB underlined/VBN in/IN the/DT scenes/NNS of/IN battle/NN ,/, where/WRB hand-to-hand/JJ combat/NN is/VBZ naturalistically/RB displayed/VBN in/IN all/DT its/PRP$ gory/NN details/NNS ,/, never/RB seen/VBN since/IN verhoeven/NN 's/POS ultra-naturalistic/JJ flesh/NN &/CC blood/NN ./.
compared/VBN with/IN this/DT naturalistic/JJ approach/NN ,/, most/JJS of/IN old/JJ hollywood/NN epics/NNS look/VBP like/IN stage/NN plays/NNS ./.
braveheart/NN also/RB employs/VBZ humour/NN at/IN the/DT right/JJ places/NNS ,/, not/RB only/RB to/TO make/VB bloody/JJ realities/NNS of/IN medieval/JJ british/JJ isles/NNS more/RBR bearable/JJ to/TO sensitive/JJ audiences/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB to/TO underline/VB its/PRP$ down-to-earth/JJ atmosphere/NN ,/, so/RB different/JJ from/IN previous/JJ historical/JJ epics/NNS ./.
what/WP makes/VBZ braveheart/NN ``/`` larger/JJR than/IN life/NN ``/`` is/VBZ his/PRP$ protagonist/NN ./.
mel/NN gibson/NN obviously/RB invested/VBD plenty/NN of/IN his/PRP$ energy/NN and/CC talent/NN in/IN bringing/VBG the/DT mythical/JJ figure/NN of/IN william/NN wallace/NN and/CC ,/, as/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, character/NN of/IN 15th/JJ century/NN poems/NNS is/VBZ transformed/VBN into/IN superhuman/NN being/VBG that/IN resembles/NNS late/RB 20th/JJ century/NN comic/JJ book/NN hero/NN ./.
wallace/NN is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN superior/JJ to/TO his/PRP$ enemies/NNS ,/, both/DT physically/RB and/CC mentally/RB ,/, yet/RB he/PRP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO show/VB his/PRP$ sensitive/JJ ,/, more/RBR vulnerable/JJ side/NN ./.
naturally/RB ,/, when/WRB the/DT character/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN epic/NN poems/NNS ,/, most/JJS of/IN historical/JJ accuracy/NN is/VBZ going/VBG down/RP the/DT drain/NN (/( which/WDT was/VBD the/DT case/NN with/IN almost/RB every/DT historical/JJ epic/NN from/IN hollywood/NN in/IN 1990s/CD )/) ./.
however/RB ,/, even/RB those/DT who/WP do/VBP n't/RB particularly/RB care/VB about/IN history/NN or/CC are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO give/VB poetic/JJ license/NN to/TO scriptwriter/VB randall/JJ wallace/NN might/MD think/VB that/IN he/PRP went/VBD over/IN the/DT top/NN in/IN idolising/VBG wallace/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT second/JJ part/NN of/IN film/NN when/WRB scottish/JJ superhero/NN manages/VBZ to/TO seduce/VB princess/NN isabel/NN (/( played/VBN by/IN sophie/JJ marceau/NN )/) and/CC make/VB her/PRP a/DT child/NN ./.
because/IN of/IN that/IN the/DT disbelief/NN is/VBZ hardly/RB suspended/VBN ,/, and/CC final/JJ scenes/NNS are/VBP n't/RB as/RB effective/JJ as/IN they/PRP should/MD be/VB ./.
mel/NN gibson/NN as/IN an/DT actor/NN is/VBZ truly/RB wonderful/JJ ,/, and/CC he/PRP is/VBZ also/RB helped/VBN by/IN small/JJ army/NN of/IN very/RB good/JJ british/JJ and/CC irish/JJ actors/NNS ./.
most/RBS memorable/JJ of/IN them/PRP all/DT is/VBZ patrick/NN mcgoohan/NN ,/, whose/WP$ cold/JJ ,/, calculated/JJ and/CC evil/JJ medieval/JJ monarch/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS effective/JJ villains/NNS seen/VBN in/IN contemporary/JJ cinema/NN ./.
brendan/NN gleeson/NN (/( who/WP would/MD later/RB become/VB famous/JJ for/IN his/PRP$ role/NN in/IN boorman/NN 's/POS general/NN )/) is/VBZ also/RB very/RB good/JJ as/IN wallace/NN 's/POS trusted/VBN companion/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN ian/JJ bannen/NN is/VBZ effective/JJ as/IN leprosy-stricken/JJ king/NN john/NN balliol/NN ./.
david/JJ o'harra/NN is/VBZ very/RB entertaining/JJ as/IN wallace/NN 's/POS irish/JJ ally/NN ,/, and/CC angus/NN macfadyen/NN brings/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN anxiety/NN into/IN his/PRP$ conscience-stricken/JJ character/NN of/IN robert/NN the/DT bruce/NN ./.
women/NNS in/IN this/DT film/NN have/VBP rather/RB thankless/JJ roles/NNS ,/, especially/RB marceau/NN as/IN one-dimensional/JJ french/JJ princess/NN ./.
catherine/NN mccormack/NN as/IN wallace/NN 's/POS wife/NN was/VBD more/RBR interesting/JJ ,/, but/CC she/PRP was/VBD eliminated/VBN from/IN the/DT picture/NN early/RB on/RB ./.
from/IN the/DT technical/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, the/DT film/NN is/VBZ also/RB very/RB good/JJ ./.
photography/NN by/IN john/NN toll/NN brings/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN scottish/JJ natural/JJ beauty/NN to/TO the/DT screen/NN ./.
on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT musical/JJ score/NN by/IN james/NNS horner/NN employs/VBZ too/RB much/JJ of/IN modern-day/JJ instruments/NNS for/IN period/NN piece/NN set/VBN in/IN medieval/JJ times/NNS ./.
although/IN mostly/RB welcomed/VBN by/IN critics/NNS and/CC audiences/NNS alike/RB ,/, braveheart/NN was/VBD often/RB criticised/VBN for/IN homophobia/NN and/CC other/JJ forms/NNS of/IN extreme/JJ conservatism/NN ./.
the/DT main/JJ reason/NN for/IN that/DT was/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/DT gibson/NN ,/, among/IN many/JJ historical/JJ facts/NNS ,/, chose/VBD to/TO be/VB faithful/JJ only/RB to/TO those/DT related/VBN to/TO sexual/JJ orientation/NN of/IN ``/`` longshank/JJ ``/`` 's/POS son/NN prince/NN edward/NN (/( played/VBN by/IN peter/NN hanly/RB )/) ./.
he/PRP is/VBZ not/RB only/RB presented/JJ as/IN a/DT villain/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT less/RBR competent/JJ in/IN villain/NN 's/POS camp/NN -/: and/CC portraying/VBG of/IN homosexuals/NNS as/IN villains/NNS or/CC inferior/RB to/TO heterosexuals/NNS is/VBZ almost/RB unforgivable/JJ sin/NN in/IN ``/`` politically/RB correct/JJ ``/`` hollywood/NN ./.
to/TO make/VB things/NNS even/RB more/RBR obvious/JJ ,/, good/JJ guys/NNS in/IN this/DT film/NN are/VBP the/DT total/JJ opposite/NN of/IN effeminate/JJ and/CC incompetent/JJ edward/NN -/: rugged/VBD macho/NN men/NNS of/IN mountains/NNS who/WP are/VBP more/RBR practical/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ because/IN they/PRP tend/VBP to/TO employ/VB conservatives/NNS '/POS common/JJ sense/NN instead/RB of/IN fashionable/JJ theories/NNS of/IN ivory/NN tower/NN liberals/NNS ./.
however/RB ,/, although/IN the/DT message/NN of/IN this/DT film/NN might/MD look/VB right-wing/JJ ,/, it/PRP owes/VBZ more/JJR to/TO leftist/VB ideology/NN of/IN various/JJ national/JJ liberation/NN movements/NNS in/IN 20th/JJ century/NN ./.
according/VBG to/TO that/DT ideology/NN ,/, oppressed/VBN classes/NNS (/( workers/NNS ,/, peasants/NNS )/) are/VBP better/RBR suited/VBN to/TO fight/VB for/IN national/JJ freedom/NN because/IN their/PRP$ members/NNS has/VBZ less/JJR to/TO lose/VB in/IN that/DT struggle/NN and/CC ,/, as/IN such/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP more/RBR radical/JJ ,/, less/RBR willing/JJ to/TO make/VB compromises/NNS and/CC more/RBR efficient/JJ ;/: on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, privileged/JJ classes/NNS (/( aristocracy/NN ,/, bourgeoisie/NN )/) are/VBP more/RBR likely/JJ to/TO betray/VB the/DT cause/NN of/IN freedom/NN and/CC be/VB in/IN cahoots/NNS with/IN foreign/JJ oppressors/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO keep/VB their/PRP$ privileges/NNS ./.
this/DT marxist/JJ worldview/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN in/IN braveheart/NN without/IN any/DT subtlety/NN ./.
in/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, whether/IN the/DT audience/NN is/VBZ patient/JJ enough/RB to/TO discover/VB hidden/JJ meanings/NNS or/CC simply/RB wants/VBZ to/TO enjoy/VB entertaining/VBG historical/JJ epic/NN ,/, braveheart/NN is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN adequate/JJ choice/NN for/IN all/DT fans/NNS of/IN this/DT recently/RB resurrected/VBN genre/NN ./.
